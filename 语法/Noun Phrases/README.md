# Noun Phrases

## What is a Modifier

Noun modifiers may also be nouns, pronouns, verbs, or phrases that include a verb.
These kinds of modifiers are typically followed by the particle  de, and the noun
phrase has the following form:

    **modifier** + 的 + **head noun**

### English vs Mandarain

In English, when a modifier includes a verb, the modifier occurs after the head noun as a relative clause introduced by a relative pronoun (‘who,’ ‘whom,’ ‘which’) or a complementizer (‘that’). In these examples, the modifier of the noun is presented in square brackets.

- that book [that I bought]
- the people [who spoke to you]

In Mandarin, all modifiers precede the head noun. In addition, Mandarin has no words that correspond to relative pronouns or complementizers. Do not attempt to translate them into Chinese.

## Examples of Modifiers

### Modifier that are nouns

孩子的衣服 (Noun phrase - head noun is 衣服 because it is the thing being described)

### Modifiers that are action verbs

寫的字 (Noun phrase - head noun is 字 and the modifier is 寫)

### Modifiers that are a verb + object

唱歌的女孩子 (Noun phrase - where the head noun is 女孩子)

## Omission of the particle 的

- when the modifier is an unmodified one syllable adjectival verb
  - 貴的車 -> 貴車
- when the modifier is closely associated with the noun, describing, for example, nationality
  - 美國的人 -> 美國人

## Noun modifiers in a series

A noun may be modified by any number of modifiers
- The modifiers occur in a s eries before the head noun
- A modifier that is a specifier and/or a number ends with a classifier. All other modifiers may end in the particle 的 

我們 【昨天看的】【剛出來的】【中國的】電影
the Chinese movie that just came out that we saw yesterday

## Omission of the head noun

If it's obvious what everyone is talking about you can ommit the head noun

這是誰做的菜 -> 這是格蘭特做的！
你要買那本書？ -> 我呀那本
