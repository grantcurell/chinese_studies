我也不想闹得太张扬
我不想泰斗人知道
闹得 = Here it's like to make a rucus but in the context of people finding out
张扬 = to make known (让人知道)
算是 = here it means that they could be called friends
反问句 = rhetorical question
这不是给我上眼药吗？ - this is a rhetorical question. Getting eye drops when you don't need them is bad so it's a lot like saying, "Isn't that a kick in the pants?"

这就叫灯下黑 - This is a bit of an analogy. He's saying that because it happened very close to him (on his doorstep), he should have known (he is the light here), but he didn't see it - it's a dark spot.

Update: It's an ancient chinese meaning - you have to know that right below the lantern is a dark spot. Because the lantern is hanging the dark spot is directly beneath and around is light

拉倒吧 - this is a less polite way of saying, "forget it" 算了

早晚 - sooner or later

我是必须得办了 - We have to resolve this. Here 必须得 is all one word. They used the le because it can alse be used to indicate a rapidly occurring action in the near future.
摊子 - here it's the same as 场子 - it's like a place of business

搞定她。 - Kill her
搞定<X> - you can use it more generically. Ex: 搞定程序

杀鸡儆猴 - you have to let the monkey see you kill the chicken. They shortened it to 杀鸡 - it means you have to shoot one in the herd.

安生 - this means they'll be quiet. The tiger gang will see you kill these people and quiet down.

- 二手 = second hand
- 跳楼大甩卖 = The price is so low the boss wants to kill himself.
- 错过 = to miss (you can't miss it)

道上 - this is a derivative of 黑道，白道 - basically like the two worlds. In ancient China there were many gangs. One could say they were 民间 - among the people. When talking about being among the people you could say 道上. Here it is a substitute for the word 帮派 (gang).

条子 - slang for cop. It comes from underground gambling in ancient china. They needed an unrelated word so when the cops would come they would say 条子来了 (paper strip comes)

贪污 - to be corrupt/corrupt/embezzled money

这是在给也称清理门户呢 - it's referring to ourselves. It's like we're the cleaners of the city. 门户 is kind of a euphamism for the city
